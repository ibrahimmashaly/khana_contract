# Khana: Increasing sustainable engagement and participation in communities

### What is Khana?
Communities all around the world suffer from a lack of participation. This is especially prevalent in crypto-communities, where stakeholder participation is very low, adversely affecting their desired outcome.
Khana is a suite of tools to further engage and increase sustainable participation in communities, using crypto-economic incentives such as dynamic token bonding curves.

## Status
**This repo is for the opensource smart contracts currently being built. They are still a work in progress so no way near deployment ready!̨**

We created a Proof of Concept (PoC) in September 2018. The implementation (smart contracts + front end code) can be found in the [Proof of Concept directory](https://github.com/khana-io/Prototype). 

The PoC is currently deployed to a handful of communities in Amsterdam, Netherlands on Rinkeby testnet. It is actively being used and tested.

#### We're hoping to work on Khana full-time in the near future, so if you would like to support us, please reach out!
